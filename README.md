# Project Proposal
## Purpose of research project: 
Why should people prevent cancer and how to prevent cancer from our daily lifestyles? We want to educate people about the risk of cancers, examples from actual patients on their lifestyles, and some potential cost for treatment, this might warn people why they should prevent cancer instead of focusing on the treatment.

## Research that has been done in this area: 

* CDC presents different cancer cases and deaths across all the races, ages and genders in the U.S. It specifically presents the top 10 cancers by rate of new cancer cases and deaths. (https://gis.cdc.gov/Cancer/USCS/DataViz.html)

* ACS(American Cancer Society) made this study on the cost of cancer. It includes the general expenditure patients spend on cancer-related health care ($87.8 billion spent in 2014), the factors of the cost, and different types of cost.  (https://www.fightcancer.org/sites/default/files/Costs%20of%20Cancer%20-%20Final%20Web.pdf )

* NIH discovers the most commonly studied risk factors for cancer on this webpage. They also included a specific page for each factor to show which cancer is most related to this risk factor. (https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk)

* The WHO suggests some risk factors that people should keep in mind when preventing cancer are including tobacco, diet, alcohol, HPV vaccine, air pollution, drugs, etc, which matches the data we found for cancer patient’s lifestyles. (https://www.who.int/health-topics/cancer#tab=tab_2)

## Data sources we will be working with:

* https://www.kaggle.com/rishidamarla/cancer-patients-data 
Source: https://data.world/cancerdatahp/lung-cancer-data/workspace/file?filename=cancer+patient+level%20data+sets.xlsx
This data includes many patient’s lifestyles, such as air quality, alcohol and drugs consumption,  diseases, diet, etc. This data is based on real patient data, but is from a personal online user.

* https://www.kaggle.com/rishidamarla/costs-for-cancer-treatment 
Source: https://data.world/xprizeai-health/expenditures-for-cancer-care
This data shows the cost for cancer care from 2010 to 2020. Since treating cancer is one of the biggest challenges, so we could extract some useful information about how much people spend on cancer treatment at the beginning of diagnosis, after diagnosis, and right before death.

* http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool
Information collection source: http://ghdx.healthdata.org/about-ghdx/our-information-sources
Accessed through the global health data exchange website and data contains information on global DALYS

* https://gis.cdc.gov/Cancer/USCS/DataViz.html
This data is from the CDC website and contains information regaurding cancer types, sex, location, race.
“Incidence data are compiled from cancer registries meeting U.S. Cancer Statistics data quality criteria covering 100% of the U.S. population. Death data are from CDC's National Center for Health Statistics National Vital Statistics System and cover 100% of the U.S. population.”

## Target Audience:
Our target audience is the average person in the US that might want to know more about cancer and how it affects different populations.

## What should our audience take away?

The audience would learn a general idea about the cancer case rate across the US. More specifically they would get an idea about  the risk factors of cancers, and the cost for cancer treatment.

## Technical Details:

**What will be the format of your final product (Shiny app, HTML page, compiled .Rmd file, etc)?**
The format of our final product will be a shiny app.

**Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges?**
No, the data set that we linked above has all the data that we need.

**What new technical skills will need to learn in order to complete your project?**
We will have to do a lot of review on the INFO201 R content.

**What major challenges do you anticipate?**
We anticipate that it may be difficult to combine data sets.
